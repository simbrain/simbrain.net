Repo for www.simbrain.net
=========================

Scripts for pushing the site are in ./scripts. They must be executed from that directory.

Tools for uploading the executables and docs are in the simbrain 3 and 4 repos.

Javadocs must be manually generated using the javatool and uploaded. Currently v3 is all that is up.
