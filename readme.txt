Repo for www.simbrain.net
=========================

Here's where the simbrain documentation should be developed.  The plan is to work on it here, then rsync it to the website periodically.

Notes
-----
http://www.simbrain.net/credits is a redirected to http://www.simbrain.net/Documentation/docs/SimbrainCredits.html


Some things _not_ currently stored here
----------------------------------------

* The actual download files
* javadocs
* Other documentation (not sure.  It's already in the main simbrain repo so would be redundant here)
