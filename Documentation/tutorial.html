I've been asked for a tutorial a few times so I put this up, announcing it as &quot;still 80% relevant.&quot; But it really is old and needs to be replaced. We are working on some video intros, the book is in the works, and when time permits someone will hopefully create a slick tutorial. For now, though, you might consider the <a href="http://www.simbrain.net/Documentation/docs/Pages/QuickStart.html">quick start</a> page instead of this one for an up-to-date (but brief) dive in to Simbrain. </strong></p>								<p><u><strong>Network</strong></u></p>								<p>(Note that I will use the word &quot;neuron&quot; for node in what follows simply because it's a more suggestive word. This is of course an artificial neural net--a far cry from actual brain tissue or more realistic simulation try neuron or genesis).</p>								<p>I will take you through the process of building a simple network. To begin,								   clear away the default network by pressing <img src="Pics/DeleteAll.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  at the bottom of the network panel. Note that to bring this bottom panel into								   and out of site you can press the <img src="Pics/Build.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  button at the top of the panel. Try pressing <img src="Pics/Build.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  a few times to get a feel for this. Now click somewhere in the black network								   panel. Where you click determines where new neurons will be laid down. Ok,								  now  that you've clicked somewhere, press the <img src="Pics/New.gif" width="24" height="24"> button a few times. A line of neuron should &quot;grow&quot; out of the point								   you clicked initially. Trying making a bunch of neurons at diff rent points								  on  the screen. </p>								<p>To select a neuron you click on it, to deselect you click in any blank area 								  of the screen. To move a neuron you simply drag it. Try moving your neurons 								  around a bit. Also, once you've selected a neuron you can adjust it's activation 								  using the up and down arrow keys. If you go below zero the neuron will turn 								  blue, representing an inhibited cell. To delete a neuron you select it, then 								  press the <img src="Pics/Delete.gif" width="24" height="24"> key.</p>								<p>To connect the neurons first select a &quot;source&quot; neuron by clicking								   on it, then hold the shift key down while clicking on a &quot;target&quot; neuron.								    That is, you &quot;shift-click&quot; from source to target neuron. A link								    should  appear between the two with a &quot;weight&quot; at the target end.								    Try connecting  some of your neurons now. </p>								<p>At the target end of each link a small circle should appear, representing the 								  weight of the connection from source to target neuron. To adjust this weight 								  you select it by clicking on it and press the up and down arrow keys. Note that 								  color is again either blue or red (inhibitory vs. excitatory ) , but that strength 								  is represented by <i>size </i>. You can delete a weight by selecting it and 								  pressing the <img src="Pics/Delete.gif" width="24" height="24"> button. Connections 								  can be made in both directions, or laid on top of one another, though in neither 								  case will the graphics depict this very well.</p>								<p>Try using these tools to build a little network. Once you've built your net 								  you can save it, <img src="Pics/save.gif" width="24" height="24">, and of course 								  you can open it later <img src="Pics/open.gif" width="24" height="24"> or email 								  it to a friend! A trading post will hopefully be on-line soon. More on network 								  files <a href="#FlatFiles">here</a>.</p>								<p>Your network is not set in stone. You can delete, add, connect, and modify 								  neurons at any time, even as the simulation runs.</p>								<p><br>								  Now that you've settled on a basic topology (pattern of nodes and connections) 								  , you can tweak the network in various ways. You can manually set the neurons 								  and weights by selecting them and pressing the up and down arrows. You can randomize 								  all the neurons at once with the <img src="Pics/RandN.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  button (&quot;n&quot; is for &quot;neuron&quot;) or randomize all the weights 								  at once with the <img src="Pics/RandW.gif" width="24" height="24">button (&quot;w&quot; 								  is for weight). You can clear all neuron and weight values with the <img src="Pics/EraserN.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  and <img src="Pics/EraserW.gif" width="24" height="24"> buttons, respectively. 								  Try banging away at these buttons to see what they do.</p>								<p>&nbsp;</p>								<p>Now you are ready to &quot;run&quot; the network. I suggest that you disconnect 								  the network from the world by setting the network-interaction button to <img src="Pics/NeitherWay.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  and by turning the gauge off, <img src="Pics/GaugeOff.gif" width="24" height="24">. 								  Now press the &quot;play&quot; button <img src="Pics/Play.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  and randomize the neurons every few seconds with <img src="Pics/RandN.gif" width="24" height="24">. 								  Note that in each case the network will quickly &quot;settle&quot; into a stable 								  state and that weights between co-active neurons will strengthen. (This is rather 								  impoverished sense of &quot;learning,&quot; resulting from setting all the neurons 								  to random values. More robust, world-based &quot;learning&quot; discussed next).</p>								<p>Note that this is a threshold based network with Helen weights (co-active								   neurons strengthen the weight between them). A more general network should								  be  available soon.</p>								<p>Observe the network learning as you press the <img src="Pics/RandN.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  button! You can also add or delete connections while the network is running, 								  to watch how connections channel activation and affect learning. Every once 								  in a while you can reset the weights with the <img src="Pics/RandW.gif" width="24" height="24">button 								  and watch learning begin anew. Press <img src="Pics/Stop.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  to stop the simulation. To proceed more slowly and carefully, you can hand set 								  neurons and step <img src="Pics/Step.gif" width="24" height="24"> the simulation 								  one iteration at a time. </p>								<p>If you are feeling fancy, try messing with the network preferences, <img src="Pics/Prefs.gif" width="24" height="24">, 								  and doing the experiments above again. If you turn off decay, for example, the 								  net will tend to fill with activation and stay activated.</p>								<p>&nbsp;</p>								<p><u><strong>World</strong></u></p>								<p>So far you have built and run a network. Now to connect it to the world. But 								  first, let's get a feel for the world by itself, leaving the network interaction 								  button in the off <img src="Pics/NeitherWay.gif" width="24" height="24"> position. 								  Try clicking anywhere in the world component, and observe that the creature 								  <img src="Pics/Mouse.gif" width="32" height="32"> will walk towards your clicks. 								  You can also use the buttons on the numeric keypad to move the creature. Also 								  note that as the creature moves nearer and further from objects, e.g.the gouda 								  cheese <img src="Pics/Gouda.gif" width="32" height="32">, that the &quot;input&quot; 								  at the bottom of the panel changes, intensifying as it moves closer and diminishing 								  as it moves away. Try cruising around for a bit and getting a feel for how the 								  input changes. These are the mock-&quot;sensations&quot; that will later be 								  sent to your network.</p>								<p>The way these mock sensations are calculated is as follows. Each object has 								  a vector of values, a &quot;signature,&quot; associated with it. To see or modify 								  this signature, shift-click on an object, say <img src="Pics/Flower.gif" width="32" height="32">. 								  This vector is diminished in proportion to the creature's distance from the 								  object. The sum of distance-diminished signatures is the &quot;input&quot; to 								  the network at any moment.</p>								<p> The preferences <img src="Pics/Prefs.gif" width="24" height="24"> dialogue								   can be used to used to tweak the world algorithms. &quot;Movement increment&quot; 								  determines how quickly the <img src="Pics/Mouse.gif" width="32" height="32"> 								  moves around. &quot;Near&quot; and &quot;Far&quot; distance are limits within								   which the diminishment of signatures is computed. If &quot;far&quot; is 100								   and 								  <img src="Pics/Mouse.gif" width="32" height="32"> is 100 units away from the								   closest object, then all 0's will show up in the input line. If &quot;near&quot; 								  is 50 and <img src="Pics/Mouse.gif" width="32" height="32"> is less then 50								   units from the closest object, that that object's full, undiminished signature								   will appear in the input line.</p>								<p>Although you can modify the &quot;smell signature&quot; of objects by shift-clicking 								  them and then saving the world <img src="Pics/save.gif" width="24" height="24">, 								  you can't currently directly alter the world. To do that, you can however open 								  a .wld file in /simulations/worlds and add or delete lines of text. These lines 								  are fairly straightforward, containing the name of an object, its location on 								  screen, and its smell signature with delimiters. Try hand-tweaking a world if 								  you like! Then save it and open it with <img src="Pics/open.gif" width="24" height="24">. 								  Again, feel free to email worlds! They're just text files.</p>								<p>OK, now we're ready to interact network and world. First, however, we have 								  to tell the network which neurons receive inputs and which express output, by 								  revisiting the build <img src="Pics/Build.gif" width="24" height="24"> toolbar 								  at the bottom of the screen. To designate a neuron as an input neuron, which 								  receives input from the external world, select it and press the <img src="Pics/Input.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  button. You will see an input arrow pop up under the neuron you selected. Click 								  again and the input symbol disappear. (NOTE that you can designate as many neurons 								  as you like &quot;input,&quot; but that only eight of them will currently receive 								  any input from the world.)</p>								<p>Let's stick with input for now, saving output until later. Now that you have 								  a few input neurons, turn on those inputs by allowing the world to talk to the 								  network. Click the network-interaction button a few times until the <img src="Pics/WorldToNet.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  button appears. This arrow &quot;points&quot; from world to network, indicating 								  that information will flow in that direction. Now &quot;push&quot; the creature 								  around by clicking in the world component and observe how the input neurons 								  are &quot;set&quot; to the same levels as you see at the bottom of the world. 								  These input &quot;sensations&quot; are then propagated through the network (each 								  time you push the creature the network <img src="Pics/Step.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  button is pressed for you ). </p>								<p>Now let's get the network to talk to the world. First we need output neurons 								  so that the network can manifest &quot;behavior&quot; in the world. The process 								  of creating output neurons is similar to that for input neurons. First, select 								  a neuron, then press the <img src="Pics/output.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  button. Click a few times to observe the output arrow appearing and disappearing 								  on the neuron. Note that the same neuron can both take and give off output. 								</p>								<p>Create a few output neurons at a place in your network where you know there 								  will be activity. If necessary, add extra links to your output neuron and manually 								  strengthen them by selecting and pressing the up arrow. As with inputs, any 								  number of outputs can be added but only eight will actually do anything.</p>								<p>First set the network interaction button to <img src="Pics/NetToWorld.gif" width="24" height="24">. 								  Now add some activation to the network (e.g. by pressing <img src="Pics/RandN.gif" width="24" height="24">) 								  then press the <img src="Pics/Step.gif" width="24" height="24"> button a few 								  times, iterating the network by hand. The most active output neuron (1-8) then 								  sends a signal to the network. Currently this &quot;signal&quot; is simply an 								  index 1-8, which will move the creature in one of 8 directions (north, northwest, 								  etc.). You can see this output signal at the top left of the world component. 								  Try hitting <img src="Pics/Play.gif" width="24" height="24"> to set it all in 								  motion, and again feel free to randomize and tweak things, to see what impact 								  this has on our friend<img src="Pics/Mouse.gif" width="32" height="32">'s behavior. 								</p>								<p>Now try setting network-world interaction to <img src="Pics/BothWays.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  so that it goes in both directions. Press play <img src="Pics/Play.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  and in effect you have a full network-world simulation running. Of course your 								  poor little creature probably has little to do at this point, except perhaps 								  running off of the screen or banging repeatedly into <img src="Pics/Fish.gif" width="32" height="32">. 								  As of yet I've just been building this tool. Soon, I hope, YOU will create a 								  simulation that does interesting stuff. When you do email it my way or post 								  on whatever trading post will be created. You can save your simulation with 								  SAVE in the FILE menu. Then you can send the .wld and .net files to me or your 								  friends.</p>								<p>&nbsp;</p>								<p><u><strong>Gauge</strong></u></p>								<p>Now you know the basics of the simulation, and already you should have been 								  able to see a lot--in particular, patterns of activity coursing through the 								  network's nodes and the way those patterns of activity strengthen the weights 								  that connect them. But there is more to see than just that, much more! To explain 								  what I mean a short theoretical digression is called for.</p>								<p>One philosophical goal of neural network theory is to explain how brains represent 								  the world. The &quot;connectionist&quot; answer to this question is that brains 								  represent the world by <i>patterns of activity</i> across their neurons--what 								  in Simbrain are patterns of color distributed across a bunch of nodes in the 								  network component. One advantage of this story is that the representations can 								  be pictured. After all, patterns of activity are vectors--ordered lists of numbers--which 								  can be thought of as points in high-dimensional spaces. So the states the network 								  goes through can be thought of as sequences of points in a high-dimensional 								  space.</p>								<p>The value of this is that we will be able to <i>see</i> how the network represents 								  the world by tracking these points in its high dimensional &quot;activation 								  space&quot; (the set of all possible patterns of activity that could occur in 								  the network). The plan is to be able to associate each activation pattern with 								  a point in a high dimensional space,and to <i>see</i> the entire history of 								  a network as a sequence of points in that space. </p>								<p>But there is a problem: these points are in <i>a high</i>-dimensional space, 								  beyond 3 dimensions, which we can't see. This is where the gauge comes in. It 								  is a &quot;Sammon-Mapper&quot;, which projects from the many dimensions of the 								  network into the 2 dimensions of the gauge panel. </p>								<p>Before explaining how this works, let's see it in action. </p>								<p>So you've got the network and world that you built above. Now let's gauge the 								  network as it walks around in the world. First, stop the network by pressing 								  <img src="Pics/Stop.gif" width="24" height="24"> and clear all the neurons with 								  <img src="Pics/EraserN.gif" width="24" height="24">. Also, I recommend that 								  you set the network interaction button to <img src="Pics/WorldToNet.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  so that you can push <img src="Pics/Mouse.gif" width="32" height="32"> around 								  and thereby activate the network, but not vice-versa. Clear any existing gauge 								  data with <img src="Pics/Eraser.gif" width="24" height="24">. Finally, turn 								  the gauge on by setting the on/off button to <img src="Pics/GaugeOn.gif" width="24" height="24">. 								</p>								<p>Now you're ready. Think of the creature as having just been born. It's never 								  been in any brain (or mental) state. Now take a step, click somewhere in the 								  world panel. You should see one green dot show up in the upper left corner of 								  the gauge panel (unfortunately) hidden behind some text. That green dot represents 								  the one single state the network has thus far been in, the one &quot;thought&quot; 								  it has had.</p>								<p>OK, what about all the text? (I know you're dying to run around like crazy--go 								  ahead if you want, you'll see &quot;dancing dots&quot; in no time!--but I'll 								  assume you restrained yourself...). &quot;Dimensions&quot; tells you the dimensionality 								  of the high-d space, which is given by the number of neurons in your net. If 								  you built a network with 10 neurons, dimension should say &quot;10&quot;. This 								  is a projection of 10-dimensional activation space. &quot;Datapoints&quot; tells 								  you how many unique states the network has been in thus far. In the case of 								  your new-born <img src="Pics/Mouse.gif" width="32" height="32"> it should say 								  &quot;1&quot;. I'll explain &quot;error&quot; and &quot;iteration&quot; in a 								  moment.</p>								<p>Now start walking the creature around. The &quot;Datapoint&quot; number should 								  be steadily increasing as it goes through more states, and soon you should see 								  the odd and fascinating &quot;dance of the green dots&quot; going full blast. 								  More on that soon. Note that it is not with <i>every </i>step that you get a 								  new state. Sometimes the creature moves around but the network doesn't change. 								  In those cases no new datapoint is added.</p>								<p>The dots are indices for brain-states /thoughts. That's the big payoff for 								  me, the philosopher. So the number of green dots on screen--the &quot;datapoint&quot; 								  number--tells you how many states that brain has been in, and also how many 								  &quot;thoughts&quot; or &quot;conscious states&quot; the creature has had. (Of 								  course the computer program isn't having thoughts--at least not according to 								  me--but brains do give rise to thoughts, and that's what we're simulating). 								</p>								<p>Note that the graphics algorithm isn't currently perfected, so that dots can 								  &quot;hide&quot; behind one another. I.e. &quot;datapoint&quot; may be greater 								  than the number of dots you actually see.</p>								<p>Now that there are a few dots on screen, you can think of them this way: each 								  green dot is a thought the creature has had some time in the past. The red dot 								  is the thought /brain-state it is having/in right now. Eventually, the dancing 								  should stop, and you should have a set &quot;horizon&quot; of past thoughts 								  the creature has had--a pattern of green dots--where the currently active thought 								  is shown in red.</p>								<p>Now, what does the &quot;shape&quot; of this pattern of dots mean? What are 								  really important are the inter-point distances. Points in any (metrical) space 								  of any dimensionality maintain distances to one another (you can calculate the 								  distance between any two such points). This counts for brain-states as understood 								  by connectionists, and the exciting philosophical idea is that it holds for 								  thoughts as well. So, if the brain is in two similar states, say as it smells 								  two similar pieces of cheese, it occupies two points in brain-space that are 								  close to one another, and also has two thoughts that are &quot;similar&quot; 								  to one another.</p>								<p>So dots that are close to each other represent brain-states (and conscious 								  states) that are similar to one another. </p>								<p>It would be nice if, as the creature walked around different objects, the gauge 								  showed dots being &quot;redded&quot; in different regions of the space. The 								  idea would be that as it was around <img src="Pics/Bluecheese.gif" width="32" height="32"> 								  it would linger in one region of state space and then as it went over to <img src="Pics/Pinkflower.gif" width="32" height="32"> 								  it would be in a completely different region of the space. But, again, I've 								  just finished the tool. Real results are yet to be obtained!</p>								<p>Here is something to play with. If while the gauge is running, you reset the 								  network's weights with <img src="Pics/RandW.gif" width="24" height="24">, the 								  network will suddenly be in <i>radically</i> different states, and the dots 								  will really start bouncing!</p>								<p>How does the gauge figure out how to project the high dimensional data to 2 								  dimensions? Well, here is where I must explain the dancing dots, and where the 								  theory gets thick. The basic idea is that it starts with a random guess, computes 								  an error, and then iterates a gradient descent algorithm to minimize that error. 								  It's kind of like fitting a line to a scatter-plot of data in 2 dimensions. 								  You modify the slope and offset of the line until it does the best job it can 								  of fitting the scatter plot. In this case, however, there are not two parameters 								  (slope and offset) to modify, but 2 times # of datapoint parameters (<i>x</i> 								  and <i>y</i> dimensions for each point on screen) to modify. For example, if 								  there are 10 dots on the screen (10 datapoints), then 20 parameters--the <i>x</i> 								  and <i>y</i> coordinates of each of these 10 dots--must be updated in an effort 								  to minimize error. Hence the dancing dots.</p>								<p>When the dots are dancing, the Sammon mapper is trying to minimize error between 								  the pattern in the high dimensional space, and the pattern in the low-dimensional 								  space. The error is right there on the screen for you to see, as it gets lower, 								  and so is a representation of the number of iterations the algorithm has gone 								  through in its effort to minimize error. You can set the minimum error and maximum 								  iterations of the algorithm in the <img src="Pics/Prefs.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  menu. You can manually step the algorithm with the <img src="Pics/Step.gif" width="24" height="24">button. 								  <img src="Pics/Play.gif" width="24" height="24"> and <img src="Pics/Stop.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  have the obvious meanings.</p>								<p>You can also save <img src="Pics/save.gif" width="24" height="24">and open 								  <img src="Pics/open.gif" width="24" height="24">your patterns, and it largely 								  works, but there are some bugs right now.</p>								<p>If you want to start over, and clear out all the datapoints, press the<img src="Pics/Eraser.gif" width="24" height="24"> 								  button.</p>								<p>Note that whenever the network is in a new state, a new dot appears and the 								  dance begins anew. This is another of way of saying that the Sammon algorithm 								  is non-scalable or non-projective--it does not accommodate brand new data. To 								  make up for this, a triangulation algorithm can be used to figure out what the 								  nearest neighbors of a new state are and then to put the new state (dot) between 								  those nearest neighbors. To turn on triangulation press <img src="Pics/TriangulateOn.gif" width="24" height="24">. 								  To turn it off press it again, <img src="Pics/TriangulateOff.gif" width="24" height="24">. 								  Note that, after turning on triangulation, that as you move the creature around 								  it interposes red dots between existing points, building on the template you've 								  already built up.</p>								<p>&nbsp;</p>								<p>&nbsp;</p>								</div>							</td>						</tr>						<tr bgcolor="#eaedc5" height="1">							<td colspan="2" height="1"></td>						</tr>							<tr bgcolor="#eaedc5" height="1">							<td width="520" height="1"></td>							<td height="1"></td>						</tr>							<tr bgcolor="#eaedc5" height="1">							<td width="520" height="1"></td>							<td height="1"></td>						</tr>							<tr align="center" valign="middle" bgcolor="#eaedc5">							<td colspan="2" align="center" valign="top" background="../Downloads/stripe_bkgrnd.gif">&nbsp;</td>						</tr>						</table>					</td>				</tr>			</table>		<p></p>	</body></html>
