At the time I was studying <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Egranger/">Richard 														Granger</a> of UC Irvine's olfactory model. This is where the cheeses and flowers 														came from. My idea was to visualize &quot;hierarchical clustering&quot; whereby 														successive &quot;sniffs&quot; yield, e.g., awareness of &quot;food&quot;, &quot;cheese&quot;, 														then &quot;gouda.&quot; I never got far with this, but I got some good icons 														and I'd still like to work on his stuff at some point, using simbrain. The word 														&quot;world&quot; was a reference to the <a href="http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/">phenomenology</a> 														I was studying alongside the neural network theory (the reference is to Husserl's 														&quot;umwelt&quot; and &quot;lebesnwelt&quot; as well as Heidegger's &quot;being 														in the world.&quot;)</p>														<p>The second version was called &quot;brain-maker,&quot; but C++ /windows graphics 														was a lot of headaches and again I didn't get far.</p>														<p>Then I took a job at a software company called Enhansiv (now <a href="http://www.teletech.com/">Teletech</a>). 														This was around the time Java's Swing libraries were coming out. With Java														and  Swing (and coworkers I could ask questions of) I finally felt I had a														tool I 														could work with. Platform independence would be a bonus. </p>														<p>I called this version of the program &quot;brain-o-scope.&quot; Here is how														I justified that name (on an earlier version of this web-site):</p>														<blockquote>														<p><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Philosophers don't usually conduct 														real experiments, but they conduct plenty of thought experiments. To non-philosophers 														this is sometimes surprising. Serious academics articulate and sometimes defend 														their claims on the basis of such imaginative constructs as &quot;Chinese 														Rooms,&quot; &quot;twin-Earths,&quot; and &quot;brains-in-vats&quot;. It has 														recently become popular in the philosophy of mind to invoke &quot;Brain-O-Scopes&quot; 														to show that looking at a brain won't tell you anything about the mind. &quot;Even 														if we had a perfect Brain-O-Scope, that wouldn't tell us a thing about the 														experience of seeing red,&quot; or so the story goes. But I think looking 														at the brain <i>can</i> tell us something about the mind, and I have tried 														to build a Brain-O-Scope to prove it. The important thing in building a better 														Brain-O-Scope is knowing what structures to focus on. I have focused on neural 														activity and attractors in state space, both of which (I claim) represent 														phenomenological structures. For more, see the dissertation abstract and sample 														chapter.</font><br>														</p>														</blockquote>														<p>However, everyone I talked to hated the name. It conjures up some 1930's &quot;whirl-o-matic&quot; 														presto-magic washing machine. </p>														<p>But it is amazingly hard to name a neural network in an accurate non-ugly way. 														I now sympathize with everyone else who's written a neural net and released 														it on the net. There's not much to work with. &quot;Brain-maker&quot; &quot;net-builder&quot; 														&quot;network-creation-kit&quot; etc etc.</p>														<p>With the deadline to submit to sourceforge (where the name can't easily be 														changed once chosen), I pestered my friends for some candidate names and then 														sent out this email:</p>														<blockquote>														<p> <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Friends... I am about to 														open-source my neural net program but must first decide on a new name for 														it. &quot;Brain-O-Scope&quot; was universally lambasted, and I've come to 														see the light. It's just too silly. The problem is most of the alternatives 														are boring (e.g. &quot;interactive neural network simulation program&quot;). 														I've cobbled together a short list of available names which I like. Please 														let me know which if any you like best, or if you have any other suggestions.<br>														</font></p>														<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">simbrain<br>														netcrafter<br>														simcrafter<br>														neurokraft<br>														brainworld</font></p>														<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">I could also choose a random 														name, as in &quot;java&quot; or &quot;simba.&quot; But none have come to mind..</font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2"><br>														</font></p>														</blockquote>														<p>I was surprised by the diversity of responses I got, and the varied attitudes 														towards neural nets and names in general they reflected. </p>														<p>Some rightly pointed out that &quot;brain&quot; preteds to be more realistic 														than it is:</p>														<blockquote> 														<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Since artificial neural 														nets of the connectionist sort are more theoretical psychology than brain 														science, I would vote for any name that doesn't have 'brain' or 'neuro' in the title.Unless, that is, there are conductance-based neuronal models in<br>the toolkit :) Then I would go for neurokrafter.</font></p></blockquote><p></p><p>But as another said:</p><blockquote> <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">I'm happiest with names that don't imply it's all just hardware, but there's not a lot of short catchy names that don't incorporate &quot;brain.&quot; </font></p></blockquote><p>Many brainstormed names on my behalf (&quot;brainstorm&quot; was itself asuggestion).  Among the other suggestions:Networld, Neural Net World, Brainprobe,Brainspace, Brainlink, BrainTamer, BrainMinder, BrainViewer, BrainPortal, Visual Brain,The Visual Brain, Virtual Brain, Brainiac , mBrain, eBrain, BrainNetWorker,BrainNetScope, BrainScoper, BrainScope, Nets4Neurons, v-synapse, e-synapse,visualthink,  virtualthink, synapses, grey(matter)storm, T.H.I.N.K (The highlyintelligent neural kit) </p><p>One person just said &quot;neur-on-your-own.&quot;</p><p>Exasparted, many said to stop trying to actually describe the thing:</p><blockquote> <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">My favorite names for large pieces of software are things that don't pretend to describe the program. &quot;Fred&quot; or &quot;James&quot; being especially keen sorts of names, but &quot;Toaster&quot; and &quot;Seatback&quot; have a nice ring too. </font></p></blockquote><p>My philosophy professor and his son Wyndham were interestingly vocal in thisregard:</p><blockquote><p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">I like a short random name, not a pseudo-tech quasi-descriptor. I thought &quot;Yoshi&quot; is the one, but Wyndham tells me it's a hot Nintendo name already copyrighted. &quot;Yoshineuro&quot;. &quot;Yo Neuro&quot;? Na. &quot;Experio&quot; Wyndham just suggested, as you tweak the neurons of experience, but that doesn't evoke neurons until you're in the know. &quot;Neuro&quot; is another. Or &quot;Neuroworld&quot;. Not bad. &quot;NeuroWorld&quot;? &quot;Mondo Neuro&quot;. Hm. &quot;Terra Neuro&quot;... How's the Latin conjugated? &quot;Terra Neura&quot;? &quot;Neo&quot;: draw in all the billions of Matrix fans. And, ya, the neural basis of experience, that's the whole deal there! &quot;Neo Neuro&quot; &quot;NeuroZen&quot;. The neural networking underlying the experience of just letting your mind happen... &quot;Leibniz&quot;. Cause he was the first to wonder what the &quot;mind&quot; would like like if you wandered through the brain at a micro level... &quot;LeibnizBrain&quot;. &quot;NeuroLeibniz&quot;. ...How about a classical artist? &quot;Da Vinci&quot;. Didn't he do early anatomy? Bet he found the neuron!... &quot;Captain Neuro&quot;, too cute. What's the first name of the first scientist to isolate the neuron? I thought that was already late, like mid-1890s?</font></p></blockquote><p>In the wake of these emails I considered &quot;Myelin&quot;, &quot;Santiago&quot;, and &quot;Golgi.&quot;I liked the latter because Golgi first made it possible to <i>see</i> neurons(even though he didn't believe in them!). But Golgi was a jerk to SantiagoRamony Cajal. Also, try saying &quot;Golgi&quot; (gol-jee) out loud! And then therewas this email:</p><blockquote> <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">golgi sounds good. does the background story involve you eating bulgolgi at a korean restaurant? </font></p></blockquote><p>Yes, there was plenty of good humor at my expense: </p><blockquote> <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">How about &quot;Neurdor&quot;--brings to mind some fantasy role-playing game overlord. What, that's *not* good? Don't use neurokraft, you might as well call it Kraftwerk and have a song accompany the download. Or may be &quot;Neural World&quot;? Or &quot;Sammon-Head&quot; . . .</font></p></blockquote><p>So in the end I stuck with simbrain. It describes the program, is easy to type in, and is in balance the least bad choice.</p></div>							</td>						</tr>						<tr bgcolor="#eaedc5" height="1">							<td colspan="2" height="1"></td>						</tr>							<tr bgcolor="#eaedc5" height="1">							<td width="520" height="1"></td>							<td height="1"></td>						</tr>							<tr bgcolor="#eaedc5" height="1">							<td width="520" height="1"></td>							<td height="1"></td>						</tr>							<tr align="center" valign="middle" bgcolor="#eaedc5">							<td colspan="2" align="center" valign="top" background="stripe_bkgrnd.gif">&nbsp;</td>						</tr>						</table>					</td>				</tr>	</table>		<p></p>	</body></html>
